      <p>Tigers have muscular bodies with powerful forelimbs, large heads and long tails. The pelage is dense and heavy; colouration varies between shades of orange and brown with white ventral areas and distinctive vertical black stripes, whose patterns are unique to each individual. Their function is likely for camouflage in vegetation such as long grass with strong vertical patterns of light and shade. The tiger is one of only a few striped cat species; it is not known why spotted patterns and rosettes are the more common camouflage pattern among felids. The tiger's stripes are also found on the skin, so that if it were to be shaved, its distinctive coat pattern would still be visible. They have a mane-like heavy growth of fur around the neck and jaws and long whiskers, especially in males. The pupils are circular with yellow irises. The small, rounded ears have a prominent white spot on the back, surrounded by black. These false "eyespots", called ocelli, apparently play an important role in intraspecies communication.</p>
      <p>The skull is similar to that of the lion, though the frontal region is usually not as depressed or flattened, with a slightly longer postorbital region. The skull of a lion has broader nasal openings. However, due to variation in skulls of the two species, the structure of the lower jaw is a more reliable indicator of species. The tiger also has fairly stout teeth; the somewhat curved canines are the longest among living felids with a crown height of up to 90 <abbr title="millimeters">mm</abbr> (3.5 <abbr title="inches">in</abbr>).</p>

      <p>The oldest recorded captive tiger lived for 26 years. A wild specimen, having no natural predators, could in theory live to a comparable age.</p>

      <h2>Size</h2>
      <p>Tigers are the most variable in size of all big cats, much more so than lions. The Bengal and Siberian subspecies are the tallest at the shoulder and thus considered the largest living felids, ranking with the extinct Caspian tiger among the biggest that ever existed. An average adult male tiger from Northern India or Siberia outweighs an average adult male lion by around 45.5 <abbr title="kilogram">kg</abbr> (100 <abbr title="pounds">lbs</abbr>). Males vary in total length from 250 to 390 <abbr title="centimeters">cm</abbr> (98 to 154 <abbr title="inches">in</abbr>) and weigh between 90 to 306 <abbr title="kilograms">kg</abbr> (198 to 675 <abbr title="pounds">lb</abbr>) with skull length ranging from 316 to 383 <abbr title="millimeters">mm</abbr> (12.4 to 15.1 <abbr title="inches">in</abbr>). Females vary in total length from 200 to 275 <abbr title="centimeters">cm</abbr> (79 to 108 <abbr title="inches">in</abbr>), weigh 65 to 167 <abbr title="kilograms">kg</abbr> (143 to 368 <abbr title="pounds">lb</abbr>) with skull length ranging from 268 to 318 <abbr title="millimeters">mm</abbr> (10.6 to 12.5 <abbr title="inches">in</abbr>). The largest wild tiger ever reported had a total body length of 3.38 <abbr title="meters">m</abbr> (11.1 <abbr title="feet">ft</abbr>) over curves and weighed 388.7 <abbr title="kilogram">kg</abbr> (857 <abbr title="pounds">lb</abbr>). In either sex, the tail represents about 0.6 to 1.1 <abbr title="meters">m</abbr> (24 to 43 <abbr title="inches">in</abbr>) of total length.</p>
      <p>Body size of different populations seems to be correlated with climate—Bergmann's rule—and can be explained by thermoregulation.[22] Large male Siberian tigers can reach a total length of more than 3.5 <abbr title="meters">m</abbr> (11.5 <abbr title="feet">ft</abbr>) over curves and 3.3 <abbr title="meters">m</abbr> (10.8 <abbr title="feet">ft</abbr>) between pegs, and can weigh up to 306 <abbr title="kilograms">kg</abbr> (675 <abbr title="pounds">lb</abbr>). This is considerably larger than the weight of 75 to 140 <abbr title="kilograms">kg</abbr> (165 to 309 <abbr title="pounds">lb</abbr>) reached by the smallest living subspecies, the Sumatran tiger. At the shoulder, tigers may variously stand 0.7 to 1.22 <abbr title="meters">m</abbr> (2.3 to 4.0 <abbr title="feet">ft</abbr>) tall. The current record weight in the wild was 389 <abbr title="kilograms">kg</abbr> (858 <abbr title="pounds">lb</abbr>) for a Bengal tiger shot in 1967.</p>
      <p>They are a notably sexually dimorphic species, females being consistently smaller than males. The size difference between males and females is proportionally greater in the larger tiger subspecies, with males weighing up to 1.7 times more than females. Males also have wider forepaw pads than females, enabling gender to be told from tracks.</p>

      <h2>Color Variations</h2>

      </figure>
      <p>A well-known allele found only in the Bengal subspecies produces the white tiger, a colour variant first recorded in the early 19th century and found in an estimated one in 10,000 natural births. Genetically, whiteness is recessive: a cub is white only when both parents carry the allele for whiteness. It is not albinism, pigment being evident in the white tiger's stripes and in their blue eyes. The causative mutation changes a single amino acid in the transporter protein SLC45A2.</p>
      <p>White tigers are more frequently bred in captivity, where the comparatively small gene pool can lead to inbreeding. This has given white tigers a greater likelihood of being born with physical defects, such as cleft palate, scoliosis (curvature of the spine), and strabismus (squint). Even apparently healthy white tigers generally do not live as long as their orange counterparts. Attempts have been made to cross white and orange tigers to remedy this, often mixing with other subspecies in the process.</p>
      <p>Another recessive gene creates the "golden" or "golden tabby" colour variation, sometimes known as "strawberry". Golden tigers have thicker than usual light-gold fur, pale legs, and faint orange stripes. Few golden tigers are kept in captivity; they are invariably at least part Bengal. Some golden tigers carry the white tiger gene, and when two such tigers are mated, they can produce some stripeless white offspring. Although a "pseudo-melanistic" effect—wide stripes that partially obscure the orange background—has been seen in some pelts, no true black tigers have been authenticated, with the possible exception of one dead specimen examined in Chittagong in 1846. These wholly or partially melanistic tigers, if they exist, are assumed to be intermittent mutations rather than a distinct species. There are further unconfirmed reports of a "blue" or slate-coloured variant, the Maltese tiger. However, while some felids do exhibit this colouration as a solid coat, there is no known genetic configuration that would result in black stripes on a blue-gray background.</p>
